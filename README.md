## What is this?
This is a prototype of a description page for the Academics requirements of a new graduate degree program. Inspired by scroll interactions like [this one](https://alfredservice.com/), we wanted to visually represent the different pieces a student would need to put together to complete the program.

## The challenge
Many of this organization's pages rely heavily on text (for example, see [here](http://learninganddesign.georgetown.edu/academics/)), and we wanted to come up with a way to visually and interactively move a user through the components of the program in a more dynamic way. We were hoping this type of presentation would make these components seem clearer and more unified.

## The solution
This is a recreation of what’s on the site—the live testing/demo site is a password-protected WordPress site, so I couldn’t share that version). Using a combination of the [ScrollMagic](http://scrollmagic.io/) and [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap) libraries, I worked with one of our talented designers, who created the visuals for the interaction, to create this prototype.

I wish we could have pushed further on this direction. I like the idea that interactively moving through information helps create meaning. Thinking about a mobile version of this (currently best viewed on screens > 800px) would be an interesting challenge as well.

Unfortunately, we didn’t go with this direction, but I like it as a proof of concept.
