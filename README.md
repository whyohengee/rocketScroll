## What is this?
This is a prototype of a description page for the Academics requirements of a new graduate degree program. Inspired by scroll interactions like this one (https://alfredservice.com/), we wanted to visually represent the different “pieces a student would need to put together to complete the program.

## The challenge
This organization loves text (for example, see [here](http://learninganddesign.georgetown.edu/academics/)), and we wanted to come up with a way to visually and interactively move a user through the the process in a more dynamic way. We were hoping this type of presentation would make the components of the program seem clearer and more unified.

## The solution
This is a recreation of what’s on the site (the live site is a password-protected WordPress site, so I couldn’t share the live version).  Using a combination of the [ScrollMagic](http://scrollmagic.io/) and [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap) libraries, I worked with one of our talented designers&mdash;who created the visuals for the interaction&mdash;to create this prototype.

I wish we could have pushed further on this direction. I like the idea that interactively moving through information helps create meaning. To not only scroll down a page, but put pieces together...that, I think, would help a user to more deeply understand concepts.

Unfortunately, we didn’t go with this direction, but I like it as a proof of concept.
