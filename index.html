        <p>The Master’s in Learning and Design program begins by establishing a common vocabulary and knowledge base. Starting with a core of courses that sketch the contours of critical topics in learning and design—data analytics, technology and innovation, leadership, and instructional design—students will move into one of four tracks that dig deeper into the challenges and opportunities of an area of work in the field.</p>
        <h2>The Program</h2>
        <p>The Masters in Learning and Design curriculum combines core requirements at the program level with track level coursework and electives for a total of 36 credit hours. It balances both theoretical and applied perspectives and engages students in reflective and integrative practice throughout their course of study.</p>

        <h2>ePortfolios</h2>
        <h3><em>Created throughout the program</em></h3>
        <p>The ePortfolio component of the MLD program offers students ways to determine who they are as reflective practitioners and ways to establish their own presence in the field.</p> 
        <p>Each student is expected to design and develop their ePortfolio to capture and make visible their learning process and outcomes. During orientation to the program, students will create their own domain at georgetown.domains and will build their digital presence throughout the 2-year student experience. This digital space is integrated in coursework and the Design Studio.</p> 
        <p>Students will use their ePortfolios to include evidence of their learning and reflect on their own practice.</p>

        <h2>Program Core</h2>
        <h3><em>12 credit hours • 4 courses</em></h3>
        <p>Students take four courses that form the program’s core. These courses offer students opportunities to explore multiple perspectives in relation to the program’s tracks – Learning Design, Technology Innovation, Learning Analytics, and Higher Education Leadership. The core courses enable students to build a common knowledge base and language to engage in discourse that challenges current perspectives in learning and design to drive the discipline forward.</p>
        <h4><em>Courses include</em></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Methods of Learning and Design (3 credits)</li>
          <li>Technology Innovation by Design (3 credits)</li>

        <h2>Track Core</h2>
        <p>In each track, students take two required courses that form the track’s core. These two courses engage learners in further exploration of key concepts and applications in relation to their selected track. While the two required courses in each track focus on further refining students’ understanding of the discipline, the Design Studio, a year-long core requirement across all tracks, enables students to apply what they are learning in areas of specific interest to each student.</p>
